# Epigraph
Carve your message into internet's history! Epigraph is an MkDocs theme which
strives to be legible, responsive, not hurting the eyes upon long sessions of
reading, with a monospaced font that makes everything look more organized,
while being big enough to be extremely legible and small enough to fit the most
content on screen.

This theme makes use of (or uses part[s] of) two other individual projects that
are dear to my heart: [the gruvbox
theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox/)'s color palette and [the Fira Code
monospaced font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/).

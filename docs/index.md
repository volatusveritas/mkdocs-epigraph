# Epigraph
Carve your message into internet's history! Epigraph is an MkDocs theme which
strives to be legible and responsive, not hurting the eyes upon long sessions
of reading, with sufficient contrast. It also features a monospaced font that
makes everything look organized and predictably layed out. The font size is
adjusted so that it is always big enough to be extremely legible and small
enough to fit the most content on screen.

This theme makes use of (or uses parts of) two other individual projects that
are dear to my heart: [the gruvbox
theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox/)'s color palette and [the Fira Code
monospaced font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/).
